# in2iframeconsent

in2iframeconsent is a TYPO3 consent management solution developed by [in2code](https://www.in2code.de/en/) to load iFrames only after a page visitor's consent.

in2iframeconsent enables the display of an iFrame consent banner.
After the page visitor agrees, the consent banner is then replaced with the correct iFrame.
